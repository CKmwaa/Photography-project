        <p>Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and of loving. What you have <strong>caught on film is captured forever.</strong> 
            Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

       <p>The quality of lenses used determine the quality of the pcitures produced.
        No matter how good the quality, there will be lens aberrations of one kind or another. </p>
       <li>Editing software</li>
       <p>Through editing, you can make your already stunning photos even more perfect by adjusting metrics like exposure, white balance and color. 
           Plus, editing your photos helps to reduce the size of your image files.
